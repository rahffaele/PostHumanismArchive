#Exploring Humanity Through Non-Human Eyes

by Anna Freri, Marco Luraschi, Raffaele Amietta

In the digital era, our identity is shaped or even confirmed, through an endless stream of images, not only from human hands but also from machines. These images, taken without human intent or intervention, encapsulate moments often overlooked—capturing the essence of life at its most unguarded.

Non-human photography offers a unique point of view into our world, free from the human subjective bias. Each image, unchosen and captured at random, presents a genuine portrayal of modern humanity—a sincere reflection of life itself.

Through the Post-Humanism Archive, we delve into this uncharted territory, exploring photography devoid of human influence. In this archive lies the most objective and truthful portrayal of our existence, serving as an indisputable testament to human existence and life in general.

The term “nonhuman photography,” as described in the book “The Creative Power of Nonhuman Photography” by Joanna Zylinska, reshapes our approach to photography. Zylinska challenges traditional human-centric views, urging us to explore the creative potential of imagery captured without direct human intervention. Her work prompts us to consider the role of technology and ethics in shaping our visual culture. Zylinska’s pioneering perspective guides our exploration of nonhuman photography’s transformative impact on contemporary visual expression.
